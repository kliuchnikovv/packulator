# Packulator

Write an application that can calculate the number of packs we need to ship to the customer.

The API must be written in Golang & be usable by a HTTP API (by whichever method you
choose) and show any relevant unit tests.

Important:
- Keep your application flexible so that pack sizes can be changed and added and removed
without having to change the code.
- Create a UI to interact with your API

Please also send us your code via a publicly accessible git repository, GitHub or similar is
fine, and deploy your application to an online environment so that we can access it and test
your application out.
